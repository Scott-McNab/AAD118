             <h3>Photography</h3>
             
             <p>Our first project was to photograph architecture of our choice using the methods of 'Macro' & 'Micro'.</p>
             
             <p>Rule of thirds - this is a basic principle in photography, most cameras have the feature to put a grid on screen which breaks it up into 3 columns and 3 rows which gives a total of 9 squares: </p>
             
             <img src="images/thirds.jpg" width=50%/>
             
             <p>As the image appears broken up it allows the you to focus on the 4 main points of interest which is ideally where the object in the photograph should be lined up to. </p>

             <br>
             
             <img src="images/thirdsgrid.jpg" />
             
             <p>Fill the frame - this can make for a very interesting shot as there may be already so much happening with the object in the image any other object in the frame may take away from the shot entirely </p>
             
             <img src="images/fill%20the%20frame.jpg" width=50%/>
             
             <p>Keep horizons, horizons - This is a very simple and obvious technique of just keeping any straight lines i.e the horizon, straight:  </p>

             <h2>Project 02</h2>
             
             <h3>Book Covers</h3>
             
             <p>For my second project of Data imaging and visualisation, I was asked to design a series of 3 book covers which had to be of the same genre and follow the same style so that they were consistent and felt like they actually belonged together. </p>
             
             <p>From the start I knew what genre and books I wanted to do, I chose the harry Potter series seeing as I was such a huge fan when I was younger (and even now). </p>
             
             <h4>Other Book Covers</h4>
             
             <p>I started my research by looking at what covers already existed for the series of books and if there were any consistencies already discovered that i could perhaps bring through into my designs. </p>
             
             <img src="images/hporiginal.jpg" width=70%/>
             
             <p>The first set of covers were from the books I had when I was a kid, and were most iconic to me. As these were books sparked my enthusiasm I decided I wanted to carry a part of them through to my design. </p>
             
             <img src="images/hp1.jpg" />
             
             <p>While looking for other variations I came across this series of covers, I took particular interest in theses covers as they displayed key parts of the story in a very clever way. </p>

             <br>
             
             <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
             
             <br>
             
             <img src="images/swissstarwars.jpg" width=50% />
             
             <p>When looking for different I stumbled across a Graphic Designer who just went by the name ‘Carmen’, although she had designed a movie poster instead of a book cover I was still intrigued by the style that she had used. What interested me the most was the simplistic design to it, of just the title and a large image however they had been positioned in a way that complemented each other, this is what gave me the basis of my design. </p>
             
             <img src="images/d&ad.jpg" />
             
             <p>I then came across a Designer called Rhiannon Edwards who studied at University of the West of England, Bristol. This is a poster that she designed for D&AD Student Awards in 2010, what I particularly like about this poster is that the main title is emphasised by it’s size and weight and how the subtitle is still there to be noticed for it’s importance however it has been made significantly smaller as it is less important but still holds enough importance to be placed just underneath as if it still has a relationship with the main title. </p>
             
             <p>Also I like the way that the information on the poster has been placed just onto the white as it make it easy to read and would have not work as well on the green as it is a smaller font. I think the actual positioning of the text works very well and gives a strong sense of Swiss Style, which is the sort of style I want to carry on to my book covers. </p>

             <p>Kinderspel Poster</p>
             
             <img src="images/kinderspel.jpg" />
             
             <h3>My Bookcovers</h3>
             
             <h4>First Draft</h4>
             
             <p>These were my first concept ideas, which just consisted of text and no images. I just tested this idea to see how it would look seeing as the Harry Potter books are usually very visual, I decided to go for a different approach just to see if it would pay off. Once I seen how the turn out I thought it was perhaps not best to go with this idea as I don't they worked as book covers</p>

             <br>
             
             <h4>Final Draft</h4>
             
             <p>For my final draft of designs I knew I wanted them to follow the 'Swiss Style' I was so keen on, to do this I looked at the specifics elements that I liked so much about each poster design i.e the large image and font size from the Star Wars poster, the positioning and relationship between image and font from Wim Crouwel's 'Kinderspel' and also the images and colours from the original book covers.</p>

             <h2>Project 03</h2>
             
             <h3>Infographic</h3>
             
             <p>The third and final project was to create an Infographic based on the World Population</p>
             
             <p>First of I had to research what an infographic was.</p>
             
             <blockquote><p>A visual representation of information or data, e.g. as a chart or diagram.</p></blockquote>
             
             <p>To get a real feel of what an Infographic was and what way it should look I decided to look at a number of different ones which shared no relation to eachother as I thought this would help give me a better understanding.</p>
             
             <h3>Examples</h3>
             
             <p>I firstly decided to look up examples of World Population Infographics as this would th=be the topic I was doing mine on, so I thought it would be best what other infographics included in theirs and how they were displayed.My particular favourite is the one shown below as I think the information is easily displayed and easy to follow, I also like the use o colours and how it is easy to read the light text off the dark background.</p>
             
             <img src="images/populationeg.png" width=50%/>
             
             <p>As I am a big sport fan and particularly Football I decided to look at some football infographics, I found that they seemed a bit cluttered and didn't necessarily like any of the styles so I decided to focus more on individual players and who better to choose than the Pele. I like this particular infographic due to the lay out using the tiles to display the information and I also like the bright colours and how they used the colours which are the best fit for this particular infographic.</p>
             
             <img src="images/peleeg.png" />
             
             <p>The third Infographic I decided to research was a gaming one, I came across some very appealing ones however I decided to look at a lot less appealing one as I found this one (although poorly designed) actually displayed the information most clearly and actually held some interesting elements.</p>
             
             <img src="images/xboxeg.jpg" width=50%/>
             
             <h3>Designers</h3>
             
             <h4>Nicholas Felton</h4>
             
             <img src="images/nicholas.jpg" />
             
             <p>Nicholas works with data, charts and statistics to come up with some interesting infographics based on his life, he calls these the 'Feltron Annual Report' which he has done for a number of years and now has a collection of around 9 which consist of locations, communications, words used and many more.</p>
             
             <img src="images/feltonreport.jpg" />
             
             <img src="images/felton08.jpg" />
             
             <h4>Brendan Dawes</h4>
             
             <img src="images/brendan.jpg" width=50%/>
             
             <p>Below are some examples of how Brendan has turned information in to a visualtion representation. The first image is of tweets from Manchester and each colour represents a different topic, the four large circles are tweets about Hurricane Sandy. The second image is tweets from Southhampton at the time of 4G being launched.</p>

             <img src="images/brendaninfo.jpg" width=50%/>
             
             <h3>Information</h3>
             
             <p>I then needed to gather information so that I could start to put it into my Infographic and also see what would be the best way to lay it out and approach my design. I started by getting the current total population and the top 3 countries with the highest population.</p>
             
             <img src="images/population.png" width=50%/>
             
             <img src="images/top3.png" />
             
             <p>I also wanted to include what percentage of the world was male and female while aslo finding out what majority religion the world was, while also including the total number of people that had lived on earth.</p>
             
             <img src="images/religion.png" width=50%/>
             
             <img src="images/approx.png" width=50%/>
             
             <h3>Outcome</h3>
             
             <p>Here is how my Inforgraphic for the Worl's population turned out.</p>
